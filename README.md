# Python Basics

This repository contains a collection of fundamental Python programs and code snippets, designed for learning and practicing core concepts. Each file demonstrates a specific idea, from basic syntax to control flow and functions.

## Current Topics

### Basic Syntax and Variables
* **HelloWorld.py**: A classic "Hello, World!" program.
* **Variables.py**: Demonstrates how to declare and use variables.
* **VarDaTypes.py**: An example of different data types in Python.
* **Input.py**: Shows how to take user input.
* **Operations.py**: An example of basic mathematical operations.

### Control Flow and Loops
* **While.py**: Demonstrates how to use a `while` loop.
* **Looping.py**: A more general example of different loops.
* **ErrorHandling.py**: Shows how to use `try-except` blocks.

### Functions and Classes
* **AgeCalculator.py**: A simple program that calculates age.
* **Calc.py** and **Calc1.py**: Examples of calculator functions.
* **Cards.py**: A program that might involve classes or functions for cards.

### Problem-Solving and Mini-Projects
* **NameCol.py**: A program for collecting names.
* **NumGuesGame.py**: A number guessing game.
* **PwdStr.py**: A password strength checker.
* **RnG.py**: A random number generator.
* **To-Do.py**: A simple to-do list program.

## Planned Additions

I plan to add more examples for more advanced topics, including:
* File I/O
* Data Structures (Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples)
* Web Scraping
